**This is my custom expression parser and evaluator built in C++ using a hand-crafted Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).**

> I’ve implemented it from scratch with:

- 🌞 A custom lexer that tokenizes input expressions  
- 🌞 A recursive descent parser that builds the AST  
- 🌞 Operator precedence climbing for correct evaluation  
- 🌞 Support for unary and grouped expressions  
- 🌞 Modular AST node types like `IntExpr`, `BinaryExpr`, `GroupedExpr`

I focused heavily on keeping the code clean, modular, and expressive — while learning how real interpreters parse and evaluate structured input.

This project is a learning-driven implementation meant to mimic how compilers and interpreters process syntax trees, with full control over parsing logic and evaluation flow.
