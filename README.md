**This is my custom expression parser and evaluator built in C++ using a hand-crafted Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).**

> I’ve implemented it from scratch with:

- 🌞 A custom lexer that tokenizes input expressions  
- 🌞 A recursive descent parser that builds the AST  
- 🌞 Operator precedence climbing for correct evaluation  
- 🌞 Support for unary and grouped expressions  
- 🌞 Modular AST node types like `IntExpr`, `BinaryExpr`, `GroupedExpr`

I focused heavily on keeping the code clean, modular, and expressive — while learning how real interpreters parse and evaluate structured input.

This project is a learning-driven implementation meant to mimic how compilers and interpreters process syntax trees, with full control over parsing logic and evaluation flow.


I'll write an indepth Docs on how this works in few weeks :)
